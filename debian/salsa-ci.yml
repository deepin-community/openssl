# Disable jobs that are failing at the time of adopting Salsa CI. The purpose of
# a CI system is to detect regressions, so it must be green initially, so change
# to red is clear. Fixing build flags and reprotest is of course needed, but
# that is an independent effort from enabling Salsa CI to protect from futher
# regressions.
